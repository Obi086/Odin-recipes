    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>Typically in Nigeria and West Africa, we use tomatoes, scotch bonnet chilli and onions in preparing this sauce.</p>
    <p>This meal can enjoyed any time in the day and good for Thanksgiving too.</p>

    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
    <li>2 pounds white yams</li>
    <li>5 large eggs</li>
    <li>1 small yellow onion, sliced</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
    <li>2 small tomatoes, diced</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt (plus more to taste)</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper (more or less to taste)</li>
    <li>1/2 red bell pepper, diced</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vegetable bouillon powder</li>
    </ul>
   <h1>Steps</h1>
   <ol>
   <li>Peel the yams and slice them into ½-inch-thick circular discs. (Note: If yams are particularly large, you can further cut these slices into half-moons.) Rinse thoroughly under cold water.</li>
   <li>Place the sliced yams in a large pot. Add ½ teaspoon of salt and enough water to cover the yams. Bring water to a boil and reduce to a simmer just until a knife pierces the yams with no resistance, 20 to 25 minutes. Then drain the excess water.</li>
   <li>When the yams are almost done, whisk the eggs in a bowl with a pinch of salt.</li>
   <li>Heat the oil in a nonstick pan over medium heat. Add the onions and saute for 3 minutes or until translucent. Add the tomatoes and cook for 2 minutes or until just softened, then stir in the bell peppers and cook a minute. Stir in the cayenne pepper and bouillon powder and season with salt to taste.</li>
   <li>Add eggs and cook, stirring occasionally, until you have created large soft curds of eggs and no liquid egg remains, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
   <li>Serve hot alongside the cooked yams.</li>
   </ol>
